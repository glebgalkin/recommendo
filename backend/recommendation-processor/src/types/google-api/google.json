They have assorted flavours (matcha, rainbow sprinkles, red fruits and flowers, sprinkled candy, triple chocolate, vanilla). I'm so delighted, the vegan donuts are also gluten-free! They are baked instead of fried. The glaze is sooo sweet, it feels heavy to eat these for breakfast. 😵‍💫\n\nThe hot chocolate came out with pretty latte art. 😍 However, my throat felt scorched dry for the rest of the day after drinking it. 🔥 I suspect the roasted cacao to be the culprit.",
